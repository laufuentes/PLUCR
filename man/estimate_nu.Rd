\title{Estimate nu}
\usage{
estimate_nu(Xi, A, X, folds, SL.library, V = 2L, threshold = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xi}{A numeric vector or matrix of adverse events outcomes.}

\item{A}{A binary vector indicating treatment assignment.}

\item{X}{A matrix or data frame of covariates.}

\item{SL.library}{Libraries for training learner}

\item{V}{Number of folds (5 by default)}

\item{threshold}{threshold estimations between \link{threshold, 1-threshold}}
}
\value{
A list of functions predicting the expected outcome for treated units or control unis, each one trained without the j-th fold.
}
\description{
This function trains conditional mean of adverse event outcome models for treated and control groups
using \code{SuperLearner}, applying cross-validation to compute out-of-fold estimates.
}

set.seed(123)

# Apply a function from the list to new data:
nu_functions(1,X[1:5, ],1)  # Predict treated outcomes
