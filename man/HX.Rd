\title{Compute the Inverse Propensity Score Weight}
\usage{
HX(A, X, prop_score)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A binary treatment indicator (0 or 1).}

\item{X}{A data frame or vector of covariates used in the propensity score model.}

\item{prop_score}{A function that takes a treatment (A) and covariates as arguments and returns the estimated propensity score.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the inverse propensity score weight.
}
\description{
This function computes the inverse propensity score weight based on treatment assignment and a propensity score model.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
prop_model <- function(A, X) { 0.5 }  # Constant propensity score for illustration
HX(1, data.frame(x1 = 1, x2 = 2), prop_model)

}
