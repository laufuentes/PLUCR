\title{Normalize a Matrix by Column Min-Max Scaling}
\usage{
phi(u)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{A numeric matrix or data frame. Each column will be normalized independently.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{u}, with all values rescaled to [0, 1].
The returned matrix has two attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{"min_X"}: A matrix containing the column-wise minima.
\item \code{"max_X"}: A matrix containing the column-wise maxima.
}
}
\description{
This function performs feature-wise min-max normalization on a matrix or data frame.
Each column is rescaled to the range [0, 1] using its minimum and maximum values.
The minimum and maximum values are stored as attributes for later inverse transformation.
}
\examples{
# Example matrix
X <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), ncol = 2)
X_norm <- phi(X)
X_norm
attributes(X_norm)$min_X
attributes(X_norm)$max_X
